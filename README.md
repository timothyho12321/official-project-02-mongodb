# CARousel

Access live demo site [here]()

![Mock-up]()

## Background

There are many car buyers and hobbyists. They enjoying learning and looking at different kinds of cars. However, there is not a website that allows users to crowdsource different types of cars and create reviews about it. 

## Project Overview

Prospective car buyers or hobbyists usually find information on the car showroom website. They want to know the look, price, functionalities and features of the car. 

Looking at the rating of cars from other users are useful for them to determine if this is a well-received car. 
Sharing these information allow them to know about the potential of buying a certain car they have in mind.

## The Five Planes of UI/UX

### Strategy

#### Organization's Goals
I usually get information on cars by reading car magazines or showroom website description. This car review site centralises all the information of different brands of cars and gives users a convenient and unbiased description of cars that they may be interested in. 


#### Users' Goals
 The users of this site are usually aged 25 -35, use the internet for researching items they want to buy and enjoy reading other's reviews of using certain products. They would like to know the benefits of a certain car, compare with other types of cars, and see the reception of other users toward the functionality of a car. 

1. **Organisation**
   - Objective: To aggregate users postings and reviews about different types of cars onto a website

2. **Users: Travellers**
   - Objective: To find a certain type of car they want to know more about and get more details on the specific functions of the car 

   - Needs:
      - Search about the car they may be interested in 
      - Create posting on cars they want to review
   
   - Demographics and Characteristics:
       - Working young people
       - Interest in car
       - Enjoys reading review websites 
   
   - Pain point:
       - want to know the specifications of a car
       - Want to see the look of a car
       - Want to know other userâ€™s opinions of the car



User Stories | Acceptance Criteria(s)
------------ | -------------
As a potential tourist to the target city/country, I am interested to know what attractions/food/activities that the location has to offer that is deemed a good experience by other travellers | Articles should be able to show all the places visited by other users and see how well they are rated by these users along with the price they spend at the attarction/food/activity
As a potential tourist that wishes to stick to a budget but also experience a good time in a particular location | Users must be able to search for articles that shows attractions that are free
As a potential tourist, I want to visit locations that are highly-rated(4-5 stars) | Articles should be searchable by the best-rated ones
As a potential tourist, I may have certain preferences when it comes to looking for attractions, I could prefer places that have scenery or activities to do | Articles should be searchable by what they are best known for, for example, searching for attractions with scenery may return articles that involves places with scenic views as part of their attraction.

### Scope

### Database

A backend server will thus be necessary in order to allow communication between the site and MongoDB. As such an Express server have been set up and deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). API endpoints are accessible via the base at https://tgc-wanderlust.herokuapp.com/.

#### Content
Content will be crowd sourced from public, thus presentation of data contributed to the site is essential. A landing page is also included for branding purposes and allows site visitors to have a quick glance and understanding of the site.

#### Functional
- Search function of all articles posted on its Country, City, Categories and/or Sub-categories
- Create new article function
- Edit and Delete function on each article 
- In order to exert control, registration/verification on email is included for actions performed on articles and collections

#### Non-functional
- Mobile responsiveness: Forms and search results display should not obstruct users' experience in the site
- Accessibility: Colors used will not make it hard for users to make out the features of the app
- Performance: Database may get larger and slower to load overtime, a loading screen is included to help bridge the gap between site and data loading

### Structure

![Site-map](./src/Images/site_map.jpg)

Note: 
Added a submission branch where users can verify their identity using his/her own email to access a list of articles he/she posted to do editing or deleting

### Skeleton
Initial prototyping is seen here ![prototype1](./src/Images/wireframe1.jpg)![prototype2](./src/Images/wireframe2.jpg)

The prototype is done with a mobile first approach and throughout the project it have been re-visited several times while working on the project and styling across devices. 

#### Color Scheme

![Colour-Scheme](./src/Images/project2_colour_theme.jpg)

- The duller colours like light grey are use to present the webpage as a more comtemporary modern website at the landing page 
- The rest of the colors are then randomly generated via [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
- The yellowish series of colours were meant to bring out the warm happy feelings associated with reminiscing about travels
- Darker colors are chosen to be used for text, shadows and for overlaying images
- Feedback was that the yellowish colours were rather contrasting with the comtemporary feels the main landing page provides. Therefore, there will be further changes made to the colour theme 

#### Font
VT323 have been chosen as the font for headings, titles, subtitles, etc, because it looked compatible with the colours 

Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif is used for all body text meant for reading, to server as a contrast to the former font with its thinner weight and lining.

There was also feedback that font-use was rather contrasting between those meant for reading and those meant for subtitles, there will also be changes made to this when colour theme is changed
